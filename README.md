This is a very efficient C Quadtree that does not use any recursion.

On my laptop at least, it handles 200k entities of wildly varying sizes at around 16mspt. Here's a screenshot of the simulation:

Made for my private use, but it doesn't take a genius to start using this by yourself.

Still in development. There are a lot of things that could be improved to increase performance.

If you want to use the simulation, just execute `make`.
